# D2Lobby2 - A Dota 2 match plugin

This is D2Lobby2, a Metamod:Source server plugin for Dota 2 match management. It was previously closed source and has been unmaintained since 2016. Now that general interest in modding the Source 2 engine has increased, I've decided to open this up in case it is useful to someone. Note that it will not function in its current state due to changes in the engine and game.
